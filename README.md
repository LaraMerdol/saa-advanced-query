# Advanced Queries

Java implementations of Graph of Interest (GoI) and Common Target/Regulator (CTR) queries from paper [Algorithms for effective querying of compound graph-based pathway databases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2784781/) Addition to GoI and CTR, it also implemets neighborhood query. CTR is also named as 'Common Stream'.

They are implemented as Neo4j Stored procedures.
