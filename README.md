# Advanced Queries

Java implementations of 'Graph of Interest' (GoI) and 'Common Target/Regulator' (CTR) queries from paper [Algorithms for effective querying of compound graph-based pathway databases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2784781/) Addition to GoI and CTR, it also implements neighborhood query. CTR is also named as 'Common Stream'.

They are implemented as [Neo4j User Defined Procedures](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/procedures-functions/).
